# Galore Avakin Community (GAC) App

The **GAC App** is an interactive roleplay ecosystem designed to simulate a full virtual society.  
It includes advanced economy systems, business and real estate management, education, and a community hub â€”  
all in a sleek, futuristic dashboard interface.  

This project is **front-end only** and runs entirely in the browser with `localStorage`.  
No backend setup is required.
